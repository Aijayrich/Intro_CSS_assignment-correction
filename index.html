            My name is Ijeoma. Technology has made life easier and better. I love
            how it helps me organize my activities. I do not need to have dates
            stuck in my head when I can simply set an event or meeting reminder on
            my calendar and leave it to do the remining. It also helps to keep in
            touch with the whole world, thanks to Social Media.

        <h3><i>What I Have Learned so Far</i></h3>
        <p><b>The importance of CSS really can't be understated. It is very important
            as it controls all design-related aspects of your website. What's more,
            CSS allows you to control and adjust the design and formatting of your
            entire website from a single spot.  It is also of three types. 
            <strong>The inline, internal and the external. </strong>
    
            Inline referss to HTML element having styling (CSS) element In
            internal CSS, you have to make use of the style tag. It is defined
            in the 'head' section of an HTML page, within a 'style' element.
           External CSS must not contain any HTML code and must be saved with a
            .css extension. The href attribute is where you define the path of the
            external css file. This method can be used by more than one html page.
            To use this method, add a link to it in the 'head' section of each
            html page.

        <h3><i>The Difference between Paddings, Margins, and Borders</i></h3>
        <p><b>Padding is the space between the content and the border, whereas margin is
            the space outside the border. Border is a line that surrounds the element.
